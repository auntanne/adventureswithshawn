## One Week! ohmigosh, it's coming up fast.... We should maybe get organized.

Let's start with a packing list.

https://gph.is/1MwIMlB

* **Clothes**: bring them, you'll need them. There's no way of knowing what the weather will be like, so be prepared for anything.  The key to a successful (and comfortable) PNW adventure is LAYERS. And not even caring if you get wet. 
* **Toiletries:** everyone involved will appreciate it if you brush your teeth and perhaps your hair while you are here. But don't bring a toilet, we have one of those and we will let you use it!
* **Swim suit**
* **Shoes**: You'll need shoes for trails (not necessarily hiking boots, we're not going to be that hard core, but something sturdy) and shoes for water (that will protect the bottom of your feet and can get wet, but also cover your feet - not flip flops)
* We can supply the following things, but feel free to byo if you are more comfortable with that and you don't want our cooties.
  * hat
  * water bottle
  * small backpack
